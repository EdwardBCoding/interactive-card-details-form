## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- Fill in the form and see the card details update in real-time
- Receive error messages when the form is submitted if:
  - Any input field is empty
  - The card number, expiry date, or CVC fields are in the wrong format
- View the optimal layout depending on their device's screen size
- See hover, active, and focus states for interactive elements on the page

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- Native Javascript

### What I learned

I learned a lot about javascript during this project. Used an incredible amount of If Statements and event listeners. Made use of both Keydown and Keyup event listeners for preventing typing wrong format and error correction respectively. The keyup event listeners in this project are my pride and joy they sift through any issues and make sure to remove error stylings but only if they're fully corrected. Overall, I found this project to be a good learning stepping stone.

### Continued development

In future projects I would like to get a chance to work more with Arrays and Objects as well as a bit of Css Grid. I think I could have made my error pushing system a bit simpler if I understood arrays better but this project got as much attention out of me as it could. **On to the next!**

### Useful resources

- [Rainy day](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l7_1aQpQTCE&ab_channel=dreamysound) and [Brown Noise](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RqzGzwTY-6w&t=8258s&ab_channel=JasonLewis-MindAmend) - This combo helped me beyond belief when it comes to sitting down and concentrating for hours.
- [Logical AND](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Logical_AND) - This article helped me shorten my if statement nests and grasp the difference between && and || and how they might be able to help me.
- [Animation End Event](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Element/animationend_event) - This article helped me find a way to activate a sequence of Javascript actions only once a certain keyframed animation ended. This was very helpful so I wouldn't have to rely on seconds which could easily need changing and easing.
